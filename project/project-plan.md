# Project Plan

## Summary

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 5 sentences. -->
This project analyzes the impact of rainfall on speeding based on data sets collected in Cologne from 2017 to 2018. For this purpose, the correlation between total daily precipitation and the number (and possibly amount) of speeding violations is investigated.

## Rationale

<!-- Outline the impact of the analysis, e.g. which pains it solves. -->
By examining the effects of rainfall on speeding, the research project can provide insights into how drivers respond to wet and impaired driving conditions. This allows for an assessment of the potential risks involved in excessive speeding despite already aggravated driving conditions. The research may help policymakers to identify areas where traffic management strategies could be implemented to reduce speeding during rainy weather, potentially improving road safety. Furthermore, the project may also contribute to the broader understanding of the relationship between weather conditions and traffic behavior, providing insights that could be used to inform the development of traffic management policies and strategies in other locations.
